# Application Software

All necessary libraries used by the application are dynamically linked and are included in the software package.
This includes runtime libraries needed by the QT framework and other compiler specific libraries. The client
already comes with the necessary pre configured settings ready for first time run but can be changed based on
personal preference.

The software package does not include Ruby runtime files.

Ruby runtime installation is required to run scripts in the frontend however the client is still
available to use without Ruby or the native scripting support.
The installation of ruby runtime is described in more detail in the [installation](/installation) page.

The application software can be downloaded from the [installation](/installation) page.

The mechanics in scripting module implementation restrict from running more than one application per copy.

## Application Structure and Files

Runtime resources for the application executable come in a pre-defined structure to facilitate its normal
functions. It is important that the pre-packaged folder structure remains unchanged but configuration
and data files can be added or changed.

To view application files On Max OS X right click on the "Frostbite.app" and open "Show Package Contents".
From there: Contents > MacOS.

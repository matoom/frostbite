# Getting started

The installation package comes with already pre configured example settings, scripts,
macros and window arrangements.
To run the application with clean default settings the pre-packaged configuration
files can be deleted before running the client.

## Connecting to server

To start playing run the connection wizard (from file menu -> connect) to create a
connection to game server.

The Frostbite frontend needs to create two connections in order to start the game session.
First it connects to the authentication server to obtain a session credentials and
using the session key, it can open the connection to the game server.

Connecting to server in four steps: fill in account details, select a game,
select a character and connect to server.

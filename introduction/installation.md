# Installation

Frostbite may be installed as a precompiled binary for some platforms.
It is recommended to use the precompiled installation options if they
are available for your platform. However, Frostbite may also be built
from source.

There are two steps to a complete Frosbite installation:

1. Installing the Frostbite application software
2. Optional - Installing Ruby to enable the Frostbite scripting

## Step 1: Installing Frostbite

There are two approaches to the installation of Frostbite:

* [Option 1 (Recommended)](../introduction/installing_from_precompiled_binaries): Installing pre-compiled packages
* [Option 2](../introduction/installing_from_source): Installing from source

> There are currently up to three platform specific pre-compiled binary packages:
>
> 1. Windows
> 2. Mac OSX
> 3. Debian / Ubuntu
>
> Note that not all release versions include precompiled binaries for
> all platforms.
>
> If the latest version does not include your preferred binary, check
> the previous releases on the same download page for availability.

## Step 2: Installing Ruby

Ruby runtime installation is required for running scripts in the
Frostbite frontend.

Frostbite scripting module has been verified to run with Ruby runtime
versions 1.9.3 and 2.2.3.

Review the detailed Ruby installation instructions for your platform:

* [Ruby on Windows](../introduction/installing_ruby_on_windows)
* [Ruby on Ubuntu](../introduction/installing_ruby_on_ubuntu)
* [Ruby on OSX](../introduction/installing_ruby_on_osx)

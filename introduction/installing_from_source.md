# Installing from source

There are six steps to building your own executable:

1. Install the Qt5 depencies and build.
2. [Download](https://github.com/matoom/frostbite/releases) the .zip or .tar.gz archives
3. Extract the source.
4. Move the extracted project to any preferred location within your home directory.
5. Prepare the build for your computer.
6. Build the project.

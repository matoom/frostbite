## User Interface

The Frostbite application has a number of GUI elements such as the toolbar, movable game windows,
navigation compass, round time display and the timer bar. This chapter describes Frostbite client
GUI in more detail.

The user interface is suited to run at resolutions 1366x768 and up however it is recommended to use it at
full hd resolution or higher (1920x1080).

### Toolbar

The toolbar is located on the top of the main story window by default but can be moved to the bottom of the
screen and can be completely hidden from the right-click context menu. Toolbar gives a quick overview of the
character status and provides some control functions for the client.

#### Dock windows

The detachable dock windows display continuous stream data separately from the main story window. They're utilized
to show real time data such as player experience, conversations, familiars, active spells, room descriptions etc.
The information about thoughts, arrivals and deaths are only shown in the dock windows and are not displayed
anywhere else on the screen. Data for dock windows is always being collected regardless of the windows being
open or closed and any previously collected data will be again visible once a dock window is reopened.

The standard Qt GUI allows to stack dock windows on top of each
other and place them adjacently to each side. In the main window area, the dock windows can be placed on top,
left or right of the screen.

#### Navigation compass

The navigation compass helps to better understand and visualize available movement paths in
the game. It can be found in the bottom right corner of the main story window.

The center area of the navigation compass is reserved for the auto-pilot indicator. It shows script
status. Active mode is indicated by red color -- meaning that a script is activated and executing.

The timer bar enables to displays timers for actions that are not regulated by in-game round times. For example
boat travel or aiming a ranged weapon. Timers can be triggered by any text highlighter event, configured
from the highlighting menu.

## Introduction

Frostbite is a desktop frontend designed for [Dragonrealms MUD](http://www.play.net/dr/).
It is free to use and follows open source principles.

The application software is developed in C++ using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).
Qt is a cross-platform application framework used for developing applications that can
run on various software and hardware platforms while maintaining native capabilities and
speed benefits.
Frostbite can be built to natively run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

Frostbite frontend includes full-featured user interface; text highlights; macros and sequences;
text ignores and substitutions; and has a scripting support with
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) scripting language -- all of which is covered
